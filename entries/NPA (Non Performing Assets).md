1. NPA(Non-Performing Assets) - A non performing asset (NPA) refers to a classification for loans or advances that are in default or in arrears. A loan is in arrears when principal or interest payments are late or missed. A loan is in default when the lender considers the loan agreement to be broken and the debtor is unable to meet his obligations.
2. Non Performing assets (NPAs) are recorded on a bank's balance sheet after a prolonged period of non-payment by the borrower.
3. NPAs place financial burden on the lender; a significant number of NPAs over a period of time may indicate to regulators that the financial fitness of the bank is in jeopardy.
4. NPAs can be classified as a substandard asset, doubtful asset, or loss asset, depending on the length of time overdue and probability of repayment.
5. Lenders have options to recover their losses, including taking possession of any collateral or selling off the loan at a significant discount to a collection agency.
