1. RTGS(Real Time Gross Settlement) - The acronym 'RTGS' stands for Real-Time Gross Settlement. Simply put, it is the process of continuous (real-time) settlement of funds, which occurs individually, on an order by order basis, without netting. In other words, your request to transfer or settle funds is carried out immediately, instead of the same happening in batches (as is the case in NEFT).
2. 'Real Time' indicates that the processing of instructions happens at the time they are received rather than at some later time. 'Gross Settlement' indicates that the settlement of fund transfer instructions occurs individually (on an instruction-by-instruction basis). Considering that the settlement of funds takes place in the books of the Reserve Bank of India, the payments made through RTGS are final and irrevocable.
