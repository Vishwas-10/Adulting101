#### ​​Differences between the two


1. Overdraft: When you withdraw more money from the account, than is actually there, then your account is said to be overdrawn. In the case of a savings account, banks neither offer nor allow overdraft facilities, whereas, this facility is provided with a Current Account.
2. Current Accounts work best for traders and entrepreneurs who need to access their accounts frequently.
3. The minimum balance required to maintain a savings account is usually low (Upto INR 5k) , but for a Current Account it is much higher in comparison(upto INR 25k).
