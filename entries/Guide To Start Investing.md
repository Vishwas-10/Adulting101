### 1. Set Your Objectives ###
Setting long-term objectives can be of great benefit when investing in stocks and shares. Whether you wish to save for your own retirement or for your child‚Äôs education expenses or to buy a property or any other reason, setting long-term goals will help you better understand the importance of saving. In case you wish to invest in a scheme or investment instrument for a short period of time and withdraw your funds after a few years, another investment instrument can be considered for investment as the volatility of the stock market offers no certainty on whether or not you can access your funds when required.

### 2. Level of Risk ###
The level of risk associated with the investment option you choose must be carefully analysed before you put your money into something. The best way to identify the risks associated with various products and identifying the best option is to conduct a comprehensive comparison between the different schemes. Doing so will enable you to figure out what level of risk each product holds and you can invest your money accordingly. Understanding the level of risk involved with investments will help you avoid those instruments that have the potential to see you incur losses.

### 3. Control Over Emotions ###
One of the primary requisites of investing in the stock market involves controlling your emotions. The market sentiment towards a company becomes evident through the price of its shares. For instance, if most investors are sceptical about the prospects of a particular company, the prices of stocks and shares will reduce. Similarly, when investors show confidence in a particular company, the prices of its stocks and shares will increase. Investors who are positive about the market are called ‚Äúbulls‚Äù and their negative counterparts are called ‚Äúbears‚Äù. The change in prices of shares is affected by the persistent conflict between the bears and bulls, and the short-term changes in prices are influenced by speculations, rumours and emotions instead of systematic analyses of the prospects, assets and management of the company.

### 4. Study the Stock Market ###
Prior to making an investment, a beginner in the stock market is advised to study the stock market for the basics including the various securities that compose the market. The fields that must be focussed on include order types, financial definitions and metrics, various kinds of investment accounts, timing of investment, methods of selecting stock, etc. Gaining a thorough understanding of the stock market will ensure that you‚Äôre in a good position to assess risks and make the right selection.
